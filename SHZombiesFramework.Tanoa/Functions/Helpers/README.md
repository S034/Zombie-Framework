# Helpers

This contains various, uncategorized helper functions used across the mission's
scripts.

Usually functions should be placed in the category that best suits their purpose,
or at least be placed in the same category that they are primarily used.
This category is here in case it is difficult to categorize the function,
or if it would be unnecessarily verbose to create a new category.
