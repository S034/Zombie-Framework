Welcome! Is this your first time seeing the mission's source code?
If so, you might want to check out the readmes in some of the function

We have summaries for:

- [Economy](Functions/Economy/)
- [Garbage Collection](Functions/GC/)
- [Helpers](Functions/Helpers/)
- [Missions](Functions/Missions/)
- [Safezones](Functions/Safezones/)
- [Saves](Functions/Saves/)
- [Tasks](Functions/Tasks/)
- [Zombies](Functions/Zombies/)
