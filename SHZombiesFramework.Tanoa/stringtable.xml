                ACE is being used by this mission. Here are some basic tips
                if you are not familiar with ACE:
                &lt;br/&gt;
                - Hold [Ctrl+Windows] to show self-interactions
                  &lt;br/&gt;
                - Hover over an interaction and release to perform it
                  &lt;br/&gt;
                - Hold [Windows] to interact with players and objects
                  &lt;br/&gt;
                - If your weapon jams, you can unjam it by pressing [Shift+R]
                  &lt;br/&gt;

                There are various vehicle service stations around base.
                Once you are parked beside one, you will need to exit the
                vehicle to service it.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Refuel:
                Walk to the gas station / fuel container and interact with it
                to grab the fuel pump.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Rearm:
                Walk to the vehicle rearm container and interact with it
                to rearm your vehicle.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Repair:
                Grab a toolkit and interact with your vehicle to perform a
                "Full Repair".

                At a rearm station, ACE can be used to replace weapon pylons
                on an existing aircraft:
                &lt;br/&gt;
                1. Grab a toolkit.
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                2. Park the aircraft near a vehicle rearm station.
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                3. Exit the vehicle, interact with it, and select "Configure Pylons".
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                4. Choose the pylons you want and click "OK" to start replacing pylons.
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                5. Once complete, walk to the rearm station and interact with
                   it to load the modified pylons with their corresponding munitions.
