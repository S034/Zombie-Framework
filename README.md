# Zombie-Framework

![](docs/images/banner_2.jpg)

An open world multiplayer mission inspired by Quiksilver's Invade & Annex
[Apex-Framework], created with the use of [RHSUSAF] and RyanD's
[Zombies and Demons] mod.
You will be working with your team to deal with the widespread infection
and complete objectives across the islands of Tanoa.

We are currently in Alpha development. For developers interested in helping,
please see the [contributing guide]!

## Features

- Procedurally generated main and side missions based on map terrain
- Loitering zombies, hordes, and vehicle wrecks
- *Blood Points* economy for purchasing AI, vehicles, and supplies
- Native self-revive and vehicle unflip actions
- Zombie loot drops based on player equipment

## ACE Compatibility

[ACE] is not required by this mission but there are various settings configured
for it (see [cba_settings.sqf]), and they can be overwritten by the server as usual.

> [!WARNING]
> Zombies and Demons has issues with ACE Medical, preventing zombies from
> dealing damage. When using [ACE], please install the [ACE No Medical] mod
> alongside it.
