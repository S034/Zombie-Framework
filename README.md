# Zombie-Framework

An open world multiplayer mission inspired by Quiksilver's Invade & Annex
[Apex-Framework], created with the use of [RHSUSAF] and RyanD's
[Zombies and Demons] mod.
You will be working with your team to deal with the widespread infection
and complete objectives across the islands of Tanoa.

We are currently in Alpha development. For developers interested in helping,
please see the [contributing guide]!
